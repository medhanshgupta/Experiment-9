## Aim: Tools for EDA - Study of Numpy Library

## Theory:
NumPy is a Python library used for efficient numerical computations with multi-dimensional arrays.

In this code:
Numpy library is faster than lists, used for numerical computation, base for pandas.   
Arrays are created using np.array() in both 1D and 2D forms.    
Array attributes such as ndim, size, shape, and dtype are used to understand structure and data type.     
Built-in functions like np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.eye(), np.arange(), and np.linspace() are used to generate arrays quickly.      
Element-wise arithmetic operations (e.g., addition and multiplication) are performed without loops.      
Statistical functions such as np.mean(), np.median(), np.max(), np.min(), and np.sum() are used to analyze numerical data.       
NumPy improves performance and simplifies mathematical operations compared to standard Python lists.      

## Conclusion:
Hence Numpy Library was implemented in Python and programs were done using it.
